Hi! I'm Arash, a full-stack problem solver (I ask my wife to call me that) and lifelong tinkerer (vibe learner?). My background is in Physics and I hold a PhD in Materials Science and Engineering. I’ve spent now over a decade navigating and contributing to complex systems in a few domains:

- **Semiconductor materials & manufacturing**: From lab-scale to high-volume production, I've worked on growth and process technologies that demand both scientific rigor and industrial execution.
- **Process engineering, experimentation & statistical thinking**: I’ve worked across full-cycle process development and NPI, often in high-uncertainty environments where experimentation matters. I’ve gotten very good at designing experiments run partial factorial DOEs, used Bayesian-inspired approaches to optimize experiments, and relied on timeseries data and intuition to troubleshoot, scale, and improve complex industrial processes.
- **Data science**: I work with large-scale data live-streams collected at sub-minute intervals from hundreds of sensors and instruments connected to furnaces running continuously for weeks or even months. Understanding and acting on that data in real time is critical to driving yield and process improvements. My analysis and visualization venue has been Python and SQL for the past few years — self-taught and applied daily. I also use MATLAB and C++ when needed.
- **Project & program management**: I’ve been fortunate to learn from a few world-class project execution masters. Their approach sparked my interest in the science of decision-making and project management (a whole different ball game in industrial R&D with that level of technical uncertainty). I asked a lot of questions, read a lot of books, earned my PMP, was given room to experiment, and have since led many large-scale global initiatives across innovation and operations (US, China, Japan).
- **Software tools & products**: I enjoy building internal tools and have spent the past few years doing more of that — mostly for myself and fellow engineers, managers, and technicians. I use agile methods and Scrum, write user stories, and bring a strong product and UX sense to what makes tools actually useful. I hold a PSM I certification and love working at the intersection of product and engineering. Lately, I've been experimenting with NanoGPT and small local LLMs just for fun (and maybe a secret project:)).

Most of my skills and learning are driven by curiosity and necessity — and often fueled by 1. needing something fast, and 2. someone telling me a variation of: "it can't be done", "it's going to take some time", or worst of all "this isn't your cup of tea", to which I say "Watch me!" (Think *The Last Dance*.) Over the years, I've gotten good at turning complex process behavior and ideas into simple, testable prototypes to get actionable insights (**fail fast, fail smart**). Richard Feynman is one of my heroes and this quote of his is one of my guiding principles, “No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it.”
